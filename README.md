# Google Dorking Tool

A simple Python tool for performing Google Dorking on a target domain to gather information and discover potential vulnerabilities. This script automates the process of running multiple dork queries and provides the results in a structured format.

## Features

- Automates Google Dorking searches for a specific domain.
- Includes predefined dork queries for file discovery, configuration files, sensitive information, and more.
- Introduces randomized delays between searches to avoid excessive requests.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or newer
- `googlesearch` Python module

You can install the required module using pip:

```bash
pip install googlesearch-python
```

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x dorking.py
   ```

2. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   ./dorking.py <domain>
   ```

   Or:

   ```bash
   python3 dorking.py <domain>
   ```

### Example

```bash
./dorking.py example.com
```

The script will search for various types of files and information on the specified domain using predefined Google Dork queries.

## Predefined Dork Queries

The tool includes the following dork queries:

- `site:<domain> filetype:pdf`
- `site:<domain> intitle:'index of'`
- `site:<domain> ext:conf | ext:cnf | ext:config | ext:ini`
- `site:<domain> ext:sql | ext:db | ext:dbf | ext:mdb`
- `site:<domain> ext:log`
- `site:<domain> ext:bkf | ext:bkp | ext:bak | ext:old | ext:backup`
- `site:<domain> ext:doc | ext:docx | ext:pdf | ext:xls | ext:xlsx | ext:ppt | ext:pptx`
- `site:<domain> intext:username | intext:password | intext:passwd`
- `site:<domain> ext:env | ext:yaml | ext:json`
- `site:<domain> ext:php intext:'phpinfo()' | intext:'PHP Version'`
- `site:<domain> 'parent directory'`

## Output

The tool prints the search results for each query and provides a complete list of URLs found during the execution.
